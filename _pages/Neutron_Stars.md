Neutron stars are extraordinary not only because they are the densest form of matter in
the visible Universe but also because they can generate magnetic fields ten orders of magnitude
larger than those currently constructed on Earth. The combination of extreme gravity with the
enormous electromagnetic  fields gives rise to spectacular phenomena like those observed on
August 2017 with the merger of a binary neutron star system, an event that generated a 
gravitational wave signal, a short γ-ray burst, and a kilonova.

With the help of the [COCAL](https://tsokaros.github.io/COCAL/) code we solve the Einstein’s equations, 
Maxwell’s equations, and magnetohydrodynamic equations to construct models of **isolated** neutron/quark 
stars. These models are further evolved in order to study their stability properties, as well as their 
gravitational and electromagnetic signatures. Topics of interest include:
 - Hydrodynamics
   - Axisymmetric or triaxial
   - Uniformly or differentially rotating
 - Magnetohydrodynamics
   - Different magnetic field topologies
 - Equation of state
