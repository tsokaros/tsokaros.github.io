# Abstract 
We evolve for the first time in full general relativity a small, collisional
N-body black hole cluster of arbitrary total mass M. The bound cluster is
initially compact (radius $R/M \sim 10$), stable, and consists of 25 equal-mass,
nonspinning black holes. The dynamical interactions of compact objects in
N-body clusters is of great interest for the formation of black holes in the
upper mass gap as well as intermediate and supermassive black holes. These are
potential sources of gravitational waves that may be detected by both current
and future observatories. Unlike previous N-body Newtonian and post-Newtonian
simulations, no "subgrid physics" is required to handle collisions and mergers.
We can therefore confirm in full general relativity several predictions from
these simulations and analytic estimates: the runaway growth of a large black
hole via repeated mergers; spindown of the central black hole with increasing
captures; the ejection of a black hole with a large asymptotic velocity due to
a several-body interaction; and a regime where mergers occur primarily via
direct collisions on highly eccentric orbits instead of quasicircular
inspirals. We extract the gravitational wave signal and find it has several
distinct features associated with the compact cluster regime. Our results
suggest the signal is sufficiently loud that next generation observatories
would likely be able to detect similar events across most of the observable
universe. This work is a preliminary proof-of-principle study that we hope will
open up a new arena for numerical relativity and the study of N-body compact
systems.
