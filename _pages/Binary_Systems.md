Single neutron stars (NSs) are already extraordinary compact objects of extreme densities and magnetic fields.
However, a binary NS system can produce spectacular phenomena that lead to even larger densities and magnetic fields pushing
our theoretical knowledge to its limits. The evolutionary path of a binary system from the early inspiral, past merger,
all the way to the formation of a relativistic jet, and the production of the heavier elements in our Universe is a
fundamental research problem.

Each binary system above can be used to probe different physical phenomena, from the geometry of spacetime, to the
neutron star equation of state, the creation of relativistic jets, or r-process nucleosynthesis.
