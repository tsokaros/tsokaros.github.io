# Abstract 
  We perform general relativistic simulations of magnetized, accreting disks onto spinning black
  hole binaries with mass ratio~$q\equiv M_{\rm 1,irr}/M_{\rm 2,irr} = 1$, $2$ and $4$. The
  magnitude of the individual dimensionless black hole spins are all~$\chi= 0.26$ and lie either
  along the initial orbital plane or $45^\circ$ above it. We evolve these systems throughout the
  late inspiral, merger and postmerger phases to identify the impact of the black hole spins and
  the binary mass ratio on any jet and their electromagnetic (Poynting) signatures.
  %\ant{These initial simulations are exploratory in nature and simplified accordingly}.
  We find that
  incipient jets are launched from both black holes regardless of the binary mass ratio and along
  the spin directions as long as the force-free parameter $B^2/(8\,\pi\rho_0)$ in the funnel and
  above their poles is larger than one. At large distances the two jets merge into a single one.
  This effect \ant{may  prevent} the electromagnetic detection of individual jets. As the accretion
  rate reaches a quasistationary state during the late predecoupling phase, we observe a sudden
  amplification of the outgoing Poynting luminosity that depends on the binary mass ratio.
  Following merger, the sudden change in the direction of the spin of the black hole remnant with
  respect to the spins of its progenitors causes a reorientation of the jet. The remnant jet drives
  a single, high-velocity, outward narrow beam collimated by a tightly wound, helical magnetic
  field which, in turn, boosts the Poynting luminosity. This effect is nearly mass-ratio
  independent. During this process, a kink is produced in the magnetic field lines, confining the
  jet. The kink propagates along the jet but rapidly decays, leaving no memory of the spin-shift.
  These results suggest that the merger of misaligned, low-spinning, black hole binary mergers in
  low-mass disks
  do not necessarily
  provide a viable scenario to
  explain X-shaped radio galaxies if other
  features are not taken into account. However, the  sudden  changes in the outgoing luminosity
  at merger may help to identify mergers of black holes in active galactic nuclei, shedding light
  on black hole growth mechanisms and the observed co-evolution of their host galaxies.
