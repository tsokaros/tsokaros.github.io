# Abstract 
We construct the first dynamically stable ergostars (equilibrium neutron
stars that contain an ergoregion) for a compressible, causal equation of
state. We demonstrate their stability by evolving 
both strict and perturbed equilibrium configurations
in full general
relativity for over a hundred dynamical timescales ($\gtrsim 30$ rotational
periods) and observing their stationary behavior. This stability is in 
contrast to earlier models which prove radially unstable to collapse.
Our solutions are highly differentially rotating hypermassive neutron stars 
with a corresponding spherical compaction of $C=0.3$. Such ergostars
can provide new insights into the geometry of spacetimes around highly
compact, rotating objects and on the equation of state at supranuclear
densities. Ergostars may form as remnants of extreme binary neutron star
mergers and possibly provide another mechanism for powering short gamma-ray
bursts.
