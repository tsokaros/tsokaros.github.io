I am a Research Assistant Professor in the [Department of Physics](https://physics.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a Faculty Fellow at the [National Center of Supercomputing Applications](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) (NCSA) and a Senior Researcher at the [Research Center for Astronomy and Applied Mathematics](http://astro.academyofathens.gr/) in the  Academy of Athens, Greece.   

<div style="text-align: justify">
My research interests lie in the general theory of relativity and the theory of
compact objects. I use supercomputers to study the physics of neutron stars,
black holes, the generation of gravitational waves, or gravitational collapse,
to name a few topics.  In the era of multi-messenger astronomy,
self-gravitating systems such as triaxial neutron stars or binary neutron stars
 provide a unique laboratory whose combined emission of
gravitational, electromagnetic waves, and possibly neutrinos offers a unique
probe to understand strong-field gravitation, the physics of compact objects
and cosmology as a whole.     </div>

Undergraduate and graduate students interested in numerical relativity and
computational astrophysics are encouraged to contact 
[me](mailto:tsokaros@illinois.edu) to discuss about potential research problems. </div>
