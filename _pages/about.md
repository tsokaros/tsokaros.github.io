I am a member of the [Illinois Relativity Group](https://relativity.physics.illinois.edu/) in the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Department of Physics](https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/tsokaros) and an [NCSA Faculty Fellow](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/about/fellowships-internships/ncsa-fellows-program/).

My expertise lies in the general theory of relativity and the theory of compact objects. I have worked in different areas whose common characteristic is the strong gravity regime, either in the context of compact objects or in a cosmological setting. 

I have co-developed the Compact Object CALculator (COCAL) code, and contributed to the further development of the Illinois General Relativistic MagnetoHydroDynamics (Illinois GRMHD) code in order to study almost every possible configuration of self-gravitating system, from triaxial neutron stars to binary black holes, binary neutron stars and many others. 

In the era of multi-messenger astronomy these systems provide a unique laboratory whose combined emission of gravitational, electromagnetic waves, and possibly neutrinos offers a unique probe to understand strong-field gravitation, the physics of compact objects and cosmology as a whole.
