# Abstract 
  Black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers are one of the most promising targets for multimessenger
  astronomy. Using  general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of BHNS undergoing
  merger we previously showed that a magnetically--driven jet can be launched by the disk +
  spinning black hole remnant {\it if} the neutron star is endowed with a dipole magnetic field
  extending from the interior into the exterior as in a radio pulsar. These self-consistent studies
  considered a BHNS system with mass ratio $q=3:1$, black hole spin $a/M_{\rm BH}=0.75$ aligned with
  the total orbital angular momentum, and a neutron star that is irrotational, threaded by an aligned
  magnetic field, and modeled by an $\Gamma$--law equation of state with $\Gamma=2$. Here,
  as a crucial step in establishing BHNS systems  as viable progenitors of  central engines that
  power short gamma--ray bursts (sGRBs) and thereby solidify their role as multimessenger sources,
  we survey different BHNS configurations that differ in the spin of the BH companion ($a/M_{\rm BH}
  =-0.5,\,0,\,0.5,\,0.75$), in the mass ratio ($q=3:1$ and $q=5:1$), and in the orientation of the
  magnetic field (aligned and tilted by $90^\circ$ with respect to the orbital angular momentum). We
  find that by $\Delta t\sim 3500M-4000M \sim 88(M_{\rm NS}/1.4M_\odot){\rm s}-100(M_{\rm NS}/1.4M_\odot)\rm s$
  after the peak gravitational wave signal a magnetically--driven jet is launched in the cases where the initial
  spin of the BH companion is $a/M_{rm BH}= 0.5$ or $0.75$.  The lifetime of the jets [$\Delta t\sim 0.5(M_{\rm NS}/
    1.4M_\odot){\rm s}-0.7(M_{\rm NS}/1.4M_\odot)\rm s$] and their outgoing Poynting
  luminosities [$L_{jet}\sim 10^{51\pm 1}\rm erg/s$] are consistent with typical sGRBs, as well as with the
  Blandford--Znajek mechanism  for launching jets and their associated Poynting
  luminosities. By the time we terminate our simulations,  we do not observe either an outflow or
  a large-scale magnetic field collimation in the other configurations we simulate. These results suggest
  that future multimessenger detections from BHNSs are more likely produced by binaries with  highly
  spinning BH companions and small tilt-angle magnetic fields.
