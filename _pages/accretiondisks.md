Single neutron stars (NSs) are already extraordinary compact objects of extreme densities and magnetic fields.
However, a binary NS system can produce spectacular phenomena that lead to even larger densities and magnetic fields pushing
our theoretical knowledge to its limits. The evolutionary path of a binary system from the early inspiral, past merger,
all the way to the formation of a relativistic jet, and the production of the heavier elements in our Universe is a
fundamental research problem.
