Black holes (BHs) immersed in gaseous environments are
ubiquitous in the Universe. Black hole-disks appear
on a great variety of scales, reflecting their diverse birth channels and sites. 
From the core collapse of massive stars and the cores of active galactic nuclei, 
to asymmetric supernova explosions in binary systems, and the merger of
compact binaries where at least one of the companions is not
a BH, BH-disks may be formed and serve as prime candidates for multimessenger astronomy.
