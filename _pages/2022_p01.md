# Abstract 
We perform the first magnetohydrodynamic simulations in full general relativity of
self-consistent rotating neutron stars (NSs) with ultrastrong mixed poloidal and toroidal
magnetic fields. The initial uniformly rotating NS models are computed
assuming perfect conductivity, stationarity, and axisymmetry.
Although the specific geometry of the mixed field configuration can delay or
accelerate the development of various instabilities known from analytic
perturbative studies, all our models finally succumb to them. Differential
rotation is developed spontaneously in the cores of our magnetars which, after
sufficient time, is converted back to uniform rotation.  The rapidly rotating
magnetars show a significant amount of ejecta, which can be responsible for
transient kilonova signatures. However, no highly collimated, helical magnetic
fields or incipient jets, which are necessary for $\GG$-ray bursts,  arise at
the poles of these magnetars by the time our simulations are terminated.
