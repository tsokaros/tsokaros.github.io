# Abstract 
The oscillation modes of neutron star (NS) merger remnants, as encoded by the kHz postmerger
gravitational wave (GW) signal, hold great potential for constraining the as-yet undetermined equation
of state (EOS) of dense nuclear matter. Previous works have used numerical relativity simulations to
derive quasi-universal relations for the key oscillation frequencies, but most of them omit
the effects of a magnetic field. We conduct full general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations
of NSNS mergers with two different masses and two different EOSs (SLy and ALF2) with three different
initial magnetic field topologies (poloidal and toroidal only, confined to the interior,
and “pulsar-like”: dipolar poloidal extending from the interior to the exterior), with four different
initial magnetic field strengths. We find that the magnetic braking and magnetic effective turbulent
viscosity drives the merger remnants towards uniform rotation and increases their overall angular
momentum loss. This causes the remnant to contract and the angular velocity of the quadrupole
density oscillation to increase in such a way that it rotates faster than the fluid itself, in stark
contrast with nonmagnetized simulations. As a result, the f2 frequency of the dominant postmerger
GW mode shifts upwards over time. The overall shift is up to ∼ 200 Hz for the strongest magnetic
field we consider and ∼ 50Hz for the median case and is therefore detectable in principle by future
GW observatories, which should include the magnetic field in their analyses.
