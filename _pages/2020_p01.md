# Abstract 
  Binary neutron star mergers can be sources of gravitational waves coincident with
  electromagnetic counterpart emission across the spectrum. To solidify their role as
  multimessenger sources, we present fully 3D, general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic
  simulations of highly spinning binary neutrons stars initially on quasicircular orbits
  that merge and undergo delayed collapse to a black hole. The binaries consist of two
  identical stars modeled as $\Gamma=2$ polytropes with spin $\chi_{\text{\tiny{NS}}}=
  0.36$ aligned along the direction of the total orbital angular momentum $L$. Each star
  is initially threaded by a dynamical unimportant interior dipole magnetic field. The
  field is extended into the exterior where a nearly force-free magnetosphere  resembles that
  of a pulsar. The magnetic dipole moment $\mu$ is either aligned or perpendicular to
  $L$ and has the initial same magnitude for each orientation. For comparison, we also
  impose symmetry across the orbital plane in one case where $\mu$~in both stars is aligned
  along $L$. We find that the lifetime of the transient hypermassive neutron star remnant,
  the jet launching time, and the ejecta (which can give rise to a detectable kilonova) are very
  sensitive to the magnetic field orientation. By contrast, the physical properties of
  the black hole + disk remnant, such as the mass and spin of the black hole, the accretion
  rate, and the electromagnetic (Poynting) luminosity, are roughly independent of the initial
  magnetic field orientation. In addition, we find imposing symmetry across the orbital
  plane does not play a significant role in the final outcome of the mergers.
  %In both cases, a magnetically-supported jet is launched roughly at
  %$t\sim 24(M_{\NS}/1.625M_\odot)\rm ms$ following the binary merger.
  Our results suggest that, as in the black hole-neutron star merger scenario, an incipient
  jet emerges only when the seed
  magnetic field has a sufficiently large-scale poloidal component aligned to the initial
  orbital angular momentum. The lifetime [$\Delta t\gtrsim 140(M_{\NS}/1.625M_\odot)\rm
    ms$] and Poynting luminosities~[$L_{\text{\tiny EM}}\simeq 10^{52}$erg/s] of the
  jet, when it forms,  are consistent with typical short gamma ray bursts, as well as with the
  Blandford--Znajek mechanism for launching jets.
